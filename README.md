# Radio-to-Mapping
Atl DSI-8 Client 10 Project. Joseph Hopkins, Carol Chiu, Anthony Chapman, Kwamae Delva

In this project we will be converting radio audio data from Broadcastify, converting it to text data, and then mapping that text data to a location. Our client is FEMA, so we will focus on audio data relevant to natural disasters.

Our previous advancements for this problem by creating a Python library storing audio data for future use, and by developing a method to map locations in multiple cities.
